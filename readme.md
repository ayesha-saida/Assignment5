Answer 1: getElementById select unique id name from html. getElementsByClassName
select class name and querySelector select the first class from multiple shared
class and querySelectorAll select all the same class.

Answer 2: To create an element into the DOM we use document.createElement() and
to insert an element we use .appendChild() or .append().

Answer 3: Even bubbling in DOM is event listening / triggering such as if user
clicked on a button in backend .addEventListener("click", function() {}) will
count how many times the button is clicked or will show an alert message like
the button is clicked.

Answer 4: Event Delegation uses a single event listener to a parent element
instead of using multiple listener to each child element.It handles elements
dynamically reducing unnecessary memory usage.

Answer 5: preventDefault() Stops the default action such as submitting empty
form and stopPropagation() Stops the event from bubbling to parent elements.
